# Python If ... Else

# a = 200
# b = 33
# if b > a:
#   print("b is greater than a")
# elif a == b:
#   print("a and b are equal")
# else:

# if a > b: print("a is greater than b")

# a = 2
# b = 330
# print("A") if a > b else print("B")

# And
# a = 200
# b = 33
# c = 500
# if a > b and c > a:
#   print("Both conditions are True")

# Or
# a = 200
# b = 33
# c = 500
# if a > b or a > c:
#   print("At least one of the conditions is True")

# Not
# a = 33
# b = 200
# if not a > b:
#   print("a is NOT greater than b")

# Nested If
# x = 41
# if x > 10:
#   print("Above ten,")
#   if x > 20:
#     print("and also above 20!")
#   else:
#     print("but not above 20.")

# The pass Statement
# if statements cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have an if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
# a = 33
# b = 200
# if b > a:
